# TMDB Movie Metadata Project

Project Description
This project involves an analysis conducted on the TMDB Movie Metadata dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains metadata about various movies, and in-depth analyses will be performed on these data. The project focuses on analyzing and visualizing information about the movies (such as revenue, popularity, genres, etc.).

Objective
The primary goal of the project is to examine the data in the TMDB Movie Metadata dataset and perform meaningful analyses. These analyses aim to explore the relationships between movie performance, genres, popularity, and other attributes. Significant insights into the movies are expected to be drawn using data analysis and visualization techniques.

Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis and visualization.
Kaggle Notebook: The environment where analyses will be conducted.
Kaggle TMDB Movie Metadata Dataset: The primary data source for analysis.

Requirements
The necessary Python libraries for the project must be installed within the notebook.

Starting Point
Download the Dataset: The TMDB Movie Metadata dataset will be downloaded from Kaggle.

Subsequent Stages
Following the steps in the ipynb file in the repository, a conclusion and recommendations will be made.
